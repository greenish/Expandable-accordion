#Expandable accordion
This implementation a jQuery UI accordion allows multiple selections to be open at a time, and adds expand all and collapse all buttons. The standard jQuery UI Accordion is built to only allow one selection to be open at a time. This is for a good reason ( http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/ ). This plugin is a time saver in as much as it adds the jQuery UI class names to enable themeroller, and expand and collapse all buttons. It will eventually also add ARIA support back in.
